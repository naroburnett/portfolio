# PokeAPI Webapp

Welcome to my latest web app project! I'm excited to share with you what I've been working on. This is a JavaScript webapp that allows a user to navigate the PokeAPI to look up Pokémon and add them to a team.

## Overview

This app has three main pages:

- The home page provides a brief description of the project and its purpose.
- The search page allows users to search for Pokémon by type, generation, name, or number.
- The team page displays the user's selected Pokémon team.

I chose to make this web app for educational purposes and because I am a big fan of Pokémon! It was challenging but also fun to build.

## How to Use

1. On the home page, click on the "Search" button to go to the search page.
2. On the search page, choose your search criteria and click on the "Search" button to display the results.
3. Click on a Pokémon to add it to your team.
4. To view your team, click on the "Team" button on the navigation bar.
