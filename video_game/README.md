# Overview

Welcome to my latest video game project! I'm thrilled to share with you what I've been working on. For this project, I decided to make a video game using the Unreal Engine 5. I know there are many game engines out there, but the Unreal Engine has always intrigued me, and I couldn't wait to dive in and see what I could create with it.

My goal was to create a simple first-person shooter game with a twist. I used assets from the Unreal Engine library to build the game's world, and then I added mechanics to pick up a weapon that shoots balls. The objective of the game is to find all the gems scattered throughout the map and shoot them down. It's a straightforward concept, but it was so much fun to build and play.

I chose to make a video game for this project because I'm a big fan of gaming, and I've always wanted to try my hand at building a game of my own. And let me tell you, it was an amazing experience! From designing the world and characters to coding the gameplay mechanics, every aspect of this project was challenging and rewarding.

 I should note that this is not a professional game. It was created solely for educational purposes. I had so much fun building it. Sadly the file is to large for github, and I have had some issues uploading it. I have provided a video showcasing it, but if you would like the file please send me a dm and I would be happy to send it your way.
