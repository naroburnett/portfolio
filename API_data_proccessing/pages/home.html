      <p>
        Welcome to Pokemon Team Builder, the ultimate app for all Pokemon
        trainers out there! With our app, you can create your very own dream
        team of Pokemon by searching through the PokeAPI and selecting your
        favorite creatures. Our user-friendly interface allows you to easily
        navigate through three different pages. The first page is the homepage,
        which welcomes you to our app and provides a brief introduction. The
        second page is the "Search Pokemon" page, where you can browse through
        the entire Pokemon database and select your desired creatures for your
        team. You can search for Pokemon by name, type, or even by their
        abilities. Once you have selected your team, head over to the third
        page, the "My Team" page. Here, you can view your team's statistics,
        including total HP, attack, defense, and speed. You can even compare
        your team's stats with other teams to see how you stack up. Get ready to
        embark on an epic journey with your very own Pokemon team!
